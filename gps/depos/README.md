# The Suhч Depo Project

The Suhч Depo Project is a fictional event that is depicted and often brought up in the Suhч Books <!-- and films --> series.

It supposedly takes place between CKS4's death, in 2018, and CKS1's death in 2022 [LC 251389].

There are a total of 175 Suhч Depos around the globe at all points after the Project was finished.

Suhч Depos are highly-classified, member-only, independent locations where the CKS can live, study, work and even just chill out and lie back.

Of the 175 Depos, these are the ones that stand out the most:

- Depo 159:

Headquarters for the RIOT Enforcers - The peak of Suhч Enforcement Officers.
- Depo 121:

Mecha-Labs.
- Depo 34:

Private School for those in need.
- Depo 38:

Private Office building. Jobs for those in need.

Every Suhч Depo is protected at all times by a wired fence surrounding the vicinity, with Point-Blank precision Anti Aircraft turrets and armored police surrounding the only two entry and exit points.

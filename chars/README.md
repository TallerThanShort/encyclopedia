# The Suhч Legion Characters
## The CKS
The CKS are Gen 1, Short-Burst M-Model Suhч. They killed almost every other Suhч and every Creator to stop the advance on universal dominance.

Originally Demigods, they now have the abilities from both lives.
### CKS1
The original freedom fighter. Died in [LC 251389].

Nicknamed "The Destroyer of Worlds" due to the fact he could split a planet in two, using nothing but his bear hands. CKS1 was the most powerful being alive.

Following [The Pact], CKS1 gave his gifts to CKS3 as his last wish upon death.
### CKS2
Armored Fighter. Only CKS that doesn't have propulsion systems.

Preferring lightweight armor when possible, CKS2 uses custom-tailored armor suits to get around.

Next to CKS3, he is the second fastest CKS.
### CKS3
Also known as TallerThanShort. Fast Heavy-Weapon Fighter. Uses his small size and high speed to his advantage.

Also a Heavy-Shield user. CKS3 was majorly defense while CKS1 was in power.
### CKS4
Died in [LC 251389]. CKS4 was the creator of many of the Suhч's armor suits, vehicles and weapons. Tech Genius.

Created the [uTube](https://common-codes.github.io/uTube/) automatic monstisation fund withdrawal script that provides the CKS 5USD/hour.

Following [The Pact], CKS4 gave his gifts to CKS1 as his last wish upon death.
### CKS5
Getaway Driver. Can drive anything.

Resource Manager. Deals with the mass amounts of money the CKS need, have and use. Has more bank accounts than sense.
### CKS6
Took over the role of Tech Genius after CKS4's death. Usually hangs around [Suhч Depo 1](https://tallerthanshort.github.io/gps/depos/#depo-1).
### CKS7
Advanced Combat Fighter. Prefers faulty fast-reload and fast-swap weapons over accurate shooting.

Lightweight shield user. Helpful in human combat, his shields are rendered almost useless in Suhч combat.
### CKS8
Shadow. Has the passive ability to turn into a 3D shadow. When in a shaded room, he can seem invisible.

Also has the active ability to turn into a 2D shadow, appearing invisible even in moderately light rooms.
## The Battle Angel's
The Battle Angel's were CKS4's pride and joy. His master project.

Designed to replicate near 100% the same abilities as ths fallen Suhч they represent, the Battle Angel's are CKS4's modern adaptation of a Suhч.

They were created prior to [The Pact], and are therefore not affected by the [Rebirth Clause].

A Battle Angel is only released upon it's representative CKS's death, or when their representative summons them. To keep them alive while not activated, they were secretly kept incubated in [AD1].
### Ibis
Ibis is CKS1's Battle Angel.

Based on CKS1, Ibis has an unstable attitude, whacks more than just a little punch, and always wears the latest fashion.
### Kanro
Kanro is CKS2's Battle Angel.

Kanro is a living armor suit.
### Waifu
Waifu, also known as Virtual Waifu, is CKS3's Battle Angel. Known mainly for her iconic sword.

Waifu is only in the Suhч Books and not the films. This is because the films keep a more original ideal where the Battle Angel's are only summoned one their represented Suhч's demise.
### UB40
UB40, also known as B40 (bee four-oh), is CKS4's Battle Angel.

Much like CKS4, UB40 has a final move - **chain reaction**. This causes UB40's demise, but is an absolute final trump card. IB40 was created by CKS4 for when his Battle Angel uses this move.
### IB40
IB40, also known as SYSbot, isn't anyone's Battle Angel, instead a reverse-engineered version of UB40, but released by accident on SYStemware Update v789-patch67.1-3
